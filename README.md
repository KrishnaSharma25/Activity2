# Automation using power of Devops -Jenkins-Docker-Github

## Problem Statement:-

1. Create docker file which will install Jenkins.

2. As soon we run this docker image or docker file it should install Jenkins.

3. With the help of job chaining,now we have to create jobs in jenkins.

# Job1:- pull the github repo automatically when some developers push repo 
  to github.

# Job2:-By looking at the code or programme file,jenkins should automatic

 start the respective language inerpreter install image container to deploy

 code eg. if code is of PHP ,then jenkins should start the container that has 

 PHP already installed.

# JOb3:- Test your webpage if it is working or not.

# JOb4:- If app is not working,then send email to developer with error message.

# JOb 5:- if container where app is running. fails due to any reason then this 

Job should automatically start the container.
